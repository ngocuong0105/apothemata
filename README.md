# Stock Data Crawler

Stock trading has never been so accessible to everybody in the world. We live in an era when the rise of the retail army and the amateur traders are transforming the markets. Investing now is simplified, personal and with a few clicks on your phone you can place orders and execute trades. However, in order to make money for trading you need data.

It is clear to everybody that web data can play a big role on the markets. Last year we saw how an army of traders on the Reddit forum *r/WallStreetBets* helped drive a meteoric rise in GameStopâ€™s stock price, forcing halts in trading and causing a major headache for the short sellers betting against it and banking on the stock falling. Single tweets of a president, influencer, entrepreneur can disrupt the markets increasing the uncertainty.

That is why, I created a simple [stock data app](https://share.streamlit.io/ngocuong0105/apothemata/app.py) where you can get:

- Historical Stock Prices from Yahoo Finance and Alpha Vantage.
- Reddit posts, comments, replies.
- Reddit memes.
- Twitter posts.

All these data is available in simple csv files on which you can do sentiment analysis, image classification (on Reddit memes where people post their positions) and other data analysis tasks to improve your trading strategies.
